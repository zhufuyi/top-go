# top-go

[top-go](https://github.com/zhufuyi/top-go) is a page showing go language related github repositories and learning materials, data from [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go), in awesome-go is hard to see those github repositories use more people, not very friendly to repository selection, so add the number of stars to each github repository, and by the number of stars descending display, mainly to make repository selection easier, **top-go** update data once every half month.

Click here to see [top 500 repositories](https://github.com/zhufuyi/top-go/blob/main/top500-repos.md).
